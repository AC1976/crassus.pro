            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2024
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Crassus Pro ("we," "us," "our," or the "App") is committed to protecting your privacy through a privacy-first design approach. <strong>All of your data is stored exclusively on your iPhone, and we do not operate any servers that store, access, or retain your information.</strong></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the app processes the minimal data that does leave your device (geocoding for maps and email sending) and outlines your rights and our commitment to your privacy.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>Crassus Pro is operated by <strong>A.C. van der Linde</strong>. For privacy inquiries, please contact us at <strong>support@crassuspro.app</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>2a. Our Privacy Model: Local-First, Server-Free</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>100% Local Storage:</strong> All your property data, invoices, expenses, financial records, and tenant information are stored exclusively on your iPhone. Crassus Pro does not operate any servers, databases, or backend infrastructure that holds your data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Leaves Your Device:</strong> Only two specific functions transmit data beyond your iPhone:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                <li><strong>Geocoding:</strong> Property addresses are sent to Apple's geocoding service on adding a Property for showing on the Imperium Map.</li>
                <li><strong>Email (Optional):</strong> Invoice content and reminders are sent through Apple's Mail app on device when you choose to email an invoice.</li>
                <li><strong>VAT report (Optional):</strong> VAT report is sent through Apple's Mail app on device when you choose to send report to auditor.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Complete User Control:</strong> You maintain absolute control over your data. You can delete any records at any time, and those records are permanently removed from your device. There is no backup copy on our servers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>3. Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The following types of information are stored exclusively on your iPhone when you use Crassus Pro. This information never leaves your device unless you explicitly use the geocoding (map) or email features:</p>
        
        <h3>Property and Portfolio Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Property addresses, descriptions, and geographic coordinates</li>
            <li>Tenant names and contact information</li>
            <li>Lease rates and lease terms</li>
            <li>Property photos and images you upload</li>
            <li>Property ownership and management details</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Financial Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Invoice information including amounts, dates, and payment status</li>
            <li>Payment records and transaction history</li>
            <li>Expense entries and receipt data</li>
            <li>VAT-related financial information and tax calculations</li>
            <li>Currency and pricing information</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Communication Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Emails generated through the App's email integration</li>
            <li>Email addresses used for invoice delivery and communications</li>
            <li>Email templates and invoice content</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Usage and System Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (device model, operating system version) - used locally only</li>
            <li>App usage data - stored locally for your records only</li>
            <li>Account subscription and trial status</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data You Import</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Property data imported via CSV files</li>
            <li>Any other data you choose to import into the App</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since all data is processed exclusively on your device, the app uses your information locally for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and maintaining core functionality (property management, invoicing, expense tracking, VAT reporting)</li>
            <li>Generating invoices, reports, and tax documents</li>
            <li>Geocoding property addresses for map display (data sent to Apple's geocoding service only when you use the map feature)</li>
            <li>Sending invoice emails via iOS Mail integration</li>
            <li>Processing in-app notifications for leases and expenses</li>
            <li>Maintaining your subscription status</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We do not use your data for analytics, marketing, profiling, or any other purpose beyond enabling the features you actively use in the app.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>100% Local Storage</h3>
        <p>Crassus Pro stores <strong>all of your data exclusively on your iPhone</strong>. We do not operate any servers and do not retain any data on remote servers. Your property information, financial records, invoices, expenses, and all other data exist solely on your device, giving you complete control and ownership of your information.</p>
        
        <h3>No Cloud Backup or Sync</h3>
        <p>Crassus Pro does not offer automatic cloud backup, iCloud sync, or any other cloud storage features. All data remains on your device. If you wish to back up your data, you control this process entirely through your device's native backup mechanisms (iTunes, Finder, or manual export).</p>
        
        <h3>Encryption and Protection</h3>
        <p>Data on your iPhone is protected by Apple's built-in iOS security features and encryption. The only instances where your data leaves your device are: (1) property address geocoding for map display, and (2) email content when you send invoices via the email integration. These are described in detail in Section 8.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
        <p>Your data is entirely within your control. You may delete individual records or all data at any time directly from the App. Deleted data is removed from your device and is no longer accessible. Since we do not hold any data on servers, there is no data to delete on our end.</p>
        
        <h2>6. No Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We cannot share your data because we do not have your data.</strong> This is not a promise or a privacy policy—it is a technical fact of how Crassus Pro is architected.</p>
        
        <p>Because all your data is stored exclusively on your iPhone and Crassus Pro has no servers or backend infrastructure, there is literally nothing to share with third parties. Your property portfolio, financial records, tenant information, and all other data exist only on your device. We have no copy of this data to sell, share, or access.</p>
        
        <p>Your data can therefore never be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sold or shared with third-party advertisers or data brokers</li>
            <li>Shared with marketing partners</li>
            <li>Used for analytics or profiling</li>
            <li>Shared with social media platforms</li>
            <li>Disclosed to any external parties for any purpose</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is not because we have chosen to implement strict access controls—it is because we do not operate the infrastructure where such sharing could occur. Your privacy is protected by our architecture, not just by our policies.</p>
        
        <p>The only limited exceptions are the geocoding service used when you display properties on a map and Apple's email service when you send invoices or vat reports - both of which are described in Sections 7 and 8. In these cases, only the specific data necessary for that function (an address for geocoding, invoice content for email) leaves your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>No Legal Data Requests:</strong> Since we do not hold any copy of your data on our servers, we cannot provide your data to law enforcement or government requests. All data exists exclusively on your device and is inaccessible to us.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Since Crassus Pro stores all data locally on your iPhone and does not operate any servers, there are minimal third-party integrations. The app integrates with the following Apple services, which operate under their own privacy policies:</p>
        
        <h3>Apple Mail Integration</h3>
        <p>When you use the email feature to send invoices, the email content is sent through Apple's native iOS Mail. We do not store, access, or retain copies of these emails. The email is sent directly from your device using your configured email account.</p>
        
        <h3>App Store</h3>
        <p>Subscription processing and app delivery are handled by Apple's App Store, which maintains its own privacy policies.</p>
        
        <h3>Geocoding</h3>
        <p>When you use the Imperium Map feature to display properties, property addresses are sent to Apple's geocoding service to convert addresses into geographic coordinates. This is described in detail in Section 8.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not integrate with any third-party analytics services, ad networks, data collection platforms, cloud storage services, or any other external services beyond the above.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Geocoding for Map Display</h2>
        <p>Crassus Pro's Imperium Map feature allows you to visualize your properties on an interactive map. To display properties on the map, property addresses stored on your device are sent to Apple's geocoding service to convert them into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). This is the primary instance where property data leaves your device.</p>
        
        <p>When geocoding occurs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your property address is sent to Apple's location services</li>
            <li>The geocoding service returns coordinate data</li>
            <li>The coordinates are used to position your property on the map</li>
            <li>No additional personal information is shared beyond the property address</li>
            <li>This process is governed by Apple's privacy policies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You cannot control whether the geocoding feature is used.</p>
        
        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Since Crassus Pro stores all data exclusively on your iPhone and does not operate any servers, your data does not leave your device or transfer to any particular jurisdiction—except in the following limited cases:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geocoding:</strong> When you use the map feature, property addresses may be transmitted to Apple's geocoding services, which may process data in various jurisdictions according to Apple's privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> When you send invoice emails or vat reports, email content is transmitted through Apple's email services and your email provider's servers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For all other data (your property portfolio, financial records, invoices, expenses, and tenant information), your data remains on your device under your sole control.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request corrections to inaccurate data</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your data (subject to legal retention requirements)</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can export your data in a portable format</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> You can withdraw consent for data processing (though this may limit App functionality)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <strong>support@crassuspro.app</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Crassus Pro is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.</p>
        
        <h2>12. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know, delete, and opt-out of sales of personal information. As we do not sell personal information, the opt-out right does not apply, but you may exercise other rights by contacting <strong>support@crassuspro.app</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>13. European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Union or United Kingdom, your data is processed under GDPR principles. You have rights including access, rectification, erasure, and data portability. We only process data where we have a lawful basis, such as contract performance, legal obligation, or your consent.</p>
        
        <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or other factors. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, where required by law, by seeking your consent.</p>
